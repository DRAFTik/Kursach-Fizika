Throughout the Old Republic, latifundias decomposed from within as a result of the outflow of the population and peasant uprisings. In the past, during the reign of Pedro II (1831—1889), the peasantry remained completely subordinate to the landowners. Each planter had his own police force, which was responsible for maintaining order within its borders and controlled the peasants."
