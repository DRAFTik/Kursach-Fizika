 # Описания # 
 XSM_power_desc: "Officially, Qinghai Province is governed by two governors: civilian Ma Lin and military Ma Bufang. The former is legally the more important figure, but as practice shows, only one law works reliably in China - the one with the strongest army."
 XSM_loyality_desc: "Although we are legally a province of the Republic of China, we should reaffirm our loyalty to the government in Nanjing in light of recent events in the country. If we do, we'll change our tax system, and also the central government will start helping us with armaments."
 XSM_cult_desc: "Most of the people in northwest China practice Islam as their religion. As we know, there are many currents in Islam and there is a long-standing struggle between them. This problem has not escaped our provinces. Unfortunately, the Salafi sect prevails among our Muslims, who believe that Islam should be a non-political religion and should support old traditions and cults. In opposition to it, there is the Yihewani sect, which has two wings: one is in favor of following Salafi ideology, while the other is a modernist current that advocates the expansion of secular education among the Muslim population, as well as Islam's support for Chinese nationalism. We can use this sect to achieve our own goals, to popularize the Kuomintang and bring ordinary people into politics. That way, they will be less exposed to Communist or secret society propaganda."
 XSM_Ma_desc: "In order for Ma Lin to hold on to power, he needs to take some measures to ensure the loyalty of those loyal to him, as well as favor from the government of the Republic of China. In addition, he should long ago correct the unfavorable state of the province's financial system, something he has been doing for several years in office. This state of affairs has been influenced by the several wars the province has been involved in."
 XSM_old_supp_desc: "Ma Lin is an old general who has formed many friendships with the leaders of various factions, movements and parties during his political and military career. Coupled with his ability to 'find an approach' in dealing with a person, this will help him to join the convenient side in time in the civil war."
 XSM_joining_SZPNO_desc: "Our province is almost surrounded by the countries that make up the country's new government, so it makes little sense for us to try to resist that power in the northwest of the country. With Lin's diplomatic skills, he'll be able to establish good relations with the new «center»."
 XSM_Join_left_Gomindan_desc: "Ma Lin fought for a long time as part of Feng Yuxiang's army, thanks to which he developed strong ties with representatives of the leftist faction of the Kuomindang. He himself shares exactly their positions on the political future of the country, so at this moment, when the left faction has embarked on the path of armed confrontation with the right, we should support them."
 XSM_support_yan_desc: "Since the Northwest National Defense Government is an amalgamation of three vastly different political movements, it's starting to play a big role as to which faction will end up gaining a majority in it. Yang Hucheng personally met with [XSM.GetLeader] to enlist his support, as they both once fought in the army of Feng Yuxiang, one of the main leaders of the leftist faction of the Kuomintang."
 XSM_create_commi_desc: "Since the Northwest National Defense Government is an amalgamation of three vastly different political movements, it is beginning to play a major role as to which faction will eventually gain a majority in it. Because of this, some Communist leaders are asking [XSM.GetLeader] to officially join the Communist Party and make their province one of the Red Army's bases."
 XSM_Low_autonomy_cinhai_desc: "To reaffirm our support for one of the factions within the NNDG, we need to reduce the autonomy of our province. Also, this will help centralize the army's management and improve its cooperation on the field of war with Japan."
 XSM_coop_with_army_desc: ""
 XSM_let_hesi_coridor_desc: "Since the leftist Kuomintang government controls very small territories, it makes sense for the sake of our survival to give them control of the strategically important Hexi corridor, where the government can evacuate in case of emergency."
 XSM_support_centralizatiom_desc: "It is long past time for our country to move away from the practice of highly decentralized provincial governance. It's only led to a long period of bloody civil war and prevented any decent resistance to Japanese aggression, so we should eliminate our autonomy for the common good."
 XSM_Ma_avanture_desc: "After the Xinhai Revolution, Tibet came out from under the influence of the Republic of China thanks to the skillful actions of the previous Dalai Lama XIII, who was well educated and had connections abroad. Now Tibet is in a period of instability caused by the death of the Dalai Lama and the search for a new reincarnation, in view of which we can try to bring it back under Chinese control by sending an expedition led by Ma Bufang to Tibet, who will install a ruler of the country favorable to us."
 XSM_bulding_work_desc: "Ma Lin is the part-time head of the Construction Bureau, or in other words the provincial Ministry/Department of Construction. In this position, he can push forward the implementation of some important infrastructure and investment projects."
 XSM_rule_cinhai_army_desc: "Now that Ma Bufan is outside our province, he is deprived of any power within it. Therefore, this is the perfect moment to 'temporarily' strip him of his powers as the military governor of Qinghai, and have Ma Lin lead the army on his own."
 XSM_central_control_desc: "Ma Lin has his own reform plan, but in order to implement them he needs to complete the centralization of government in his own hands, which he began by gradually eliminating the influence of his nephew Ma Bufan."
 XSM_change_tibet_opinion_desc: "We have territories massively populated by Tibetans under our control. The only way to fully integrate them into our province is not to conduct punitive raids, plundering the local population, to conduct economic investment, proving that Chinese rule is a better choice than that of the Tibetan aristocracy."
 XSM_recruit_new_soldiers_desc: "Since most of our army went with Ma Bufan to Tibet to restore the Chinese Republic's control over those lands, we need to start creating new units to defend our own territories."
 XSM_low_control_journalists_desc: "Ma Bufan has often spoken out with ideas of restricting free speech, which has frightened many newspaper owners in Qinghai, as it could deprive them of their profits. Against this background, we can give even more freedoms to the press, thus improving our own reputation among the public, politicians and newspaper publishers."
 XSM_low_officer_courpus_desc: "Since the rule of Ma Linem Province has survived largely due to the loyalty of our army's top officers, it is worth considering that we should repay new ranks and honors to preserve it."
 XSM_create_koordinate_shtabe_desc: "In light of the upcoming major war, we should be busy reforming the army. Especially since it was divided after Ma Bufan's campaign into Tibet began, then we will have to re-form the lion's share of units, as well as form a headquarters where military matters will be decided collegially. In this way, we will further win the confidence of the officers."
 XSM_train_soldiers_desc: "The armies of the northwestern are far behind in quality even compared to the armies of the central provinces. This is largely due to outdated weaponry, but in addition another major problem is the archaic method of training and practicing soldiers and officers."
 XSM_military_and_civilian_desc: "We need to finally deal with the issue of provincial governance. Ma Bufan has shown us quite a dangerous precedent of dual rule due to the existence of the military governor position. One solution to this problem may be to return to the system of the dujunate, a governor combining the powers of military and civilian rule. It existed in the period before the Northern Campaign in the Beiyan Republic. Although the Kuomintang officially abolished it, the governor of remote Xinjiang Province continues to follow it."
 XSM_no_gubernator_desc: "We need to finally deal with the issue of provincial governance. Ma Bufan has shown us quite a dangerous precedent of dual rule due to the existence of the military governor position. One solution to this problem may be to abolish the position of military governor as such. Some believe that Chiang Kai-shek introduced such a system of provincial government following the well-known principle of "divide and conquer" in order to deliberately prevent the formation of strong power of governors in individual provinces."
 XSM_commy_strategy_desc: "Ma Lin had some contacts with Communist leaders and also closely observed their "Long March" from central China to the northwest. During it, the Red Army gained some good experience in guerrilla warfare, which may come in handy in our war with Japan."
 XSM_gorizontal_army_desc: "Our province is quite large, so we have to control a long border. Because of this, it makes sense to create a decentralized army of a large number of small units that we can use to cover all the territories under our control."
 XSM_terra_search_desc: "With our army being reformed into something more suited to the landscape of the province, we should think about forming special scout units to keep an eye on the terrain."
 XSM_crate_def_point_desc: "Considering the mountainous landscape of our terrain, it will be most appropriate to build fortifications in narrow crevices and near large and important roads, thanks to which we will be able to confidently control them without letting enemy troops through."
 XSM_repair_airports_desc: "Yushu Batang Airport is of strategic importance to the Republic of China. Thanks to it, our aviation has easy access to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and consequently, by possessing such an airport we can exert political pressure on the Tibetan government. The problem is that it was destroyed in the last Sino-Tibetan war in 1932."
 XSM_press_separate_desc: "With our strategically important position in the northwest of the country, we can exert pressure on Xinjiang and Tibet provinces, whose leaders often resort to separatist actions."
 XSM_figt_for_title_desc: "There has been a back-and-forth struggle between members of the Ma family since the beginning of their personal control of the northwest province for the right to be considered the "chief king of northwest China." Now is the best time to find out in battle."
 XSM_piece_unification_desc: "We must unite with the other Ma cliques in the northwest at such a difficult hour for the sake of defeating our common enemy."
 XSM_cult_finance_desc: "The members of the Yihewani sect have established close contact with the provincial government. They are pleased with the support they have received, but ask for the most important thing: funding to spread their ideas. However, our condition in this deal will be that the Yihewani's finally switch to the modernist wing of the movement and abandon their old principles."
 XSM_licvidate_salafite_desc: "We must do away with the Salafists once and for all, otherwise their view of Islam will greatly hinder the modernization and development of the province. After the Ikhwan split into two camps, they have gained strong support and are beginning their agitation among ordinary residents in various areas of Qinghai."
 XSM_cult_ideas_desc: "Since Ma Bufang has lost his influence over our government, Ma Lin can pursue his long-standing plan: religious and social modernization of public life in his province."
 XSM_moderate_socium_desc: "Thanks to the modernist ideas promoted by the Ikhawan sect, we can concurrently engage in raising the population, especially Muslims, to embrace a modern way of life."
 XSM_china_nationalism_desc: "Thanks to the modernist ideas promoted by the Yihewang sect, we can concurrently engage in the rise of general Chinese nationalism, which will eliminate the remnants of social tension between Han Chinese and Hui."
 XSM_svet_education_desc: "One of the important ideas advocated by the Yihewani sect is the importance of introducing secular education among the Muslim population in the province. By doing so, we will be able to significantly increase the percentage of the population who are educated and receive higher education."
 XSM_low_economy_control_desc: "Ma Lin is in favor of deregulating economic relations, eliminating monopolies in some sectors of the economy and getting rid of the remnants of feudalism. All this should usher in a new economic growth for the province and improve the quality of life of ordinary people."
 XSM_socium_system_support_desc: "Despite his liberal economic policies, Ma Lin remains committed to Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles, and accordingly one of his reforms should create a social support system for the people by increasing taxes on the top and wealthy landowners and businessmen."
 XSM_create_infrastructure_desc: "One of Qinghai's major problems remains its inability to provide food for itself, so the population has to buy food from traders in other provinces. To support the latter, we must improve the quality of roads with neighboring provinces."
 XSM_eat_sklad_grow_desc: "One of the problems of our province is that it is almost impossible to feed itself. Food has to be brought to the markets from neighboring regions more favorable for agriculture."
 XSM_Ma_bufang_desc: "The post of governor of Qinghai Province is a very popular position, and given the tradition of hereditary succession and the large number of sons in the old militarists, one cannot expect a quiet rule. In that case, Bufan needs to start by getting rid of at least some of Ma Lin's active supporters in the government to replace the loyalists with people loyal to himself."
 XSM_Sinin_theatre_desc: "Ma Bufan is keeping a close eye on cultural development in the province. One of his first proposals in his new post was to build Sinin's first theater."
 XSM_save_art_desc: "Bufan is interested in culture and art, as through them it is possible to raise the morale of soldiers in battles, as well as create pleasant leisure time for ordinary citizens."
 XSM_forest_rise_desc: "Like most other members of the Ma family, Bufan believes that one of the pillars of the province's development is to restore the forest fund in the territory under our control. This belief stems from the fact that most of our territories are dry deserts with an uncomfortable landscape."
 XSM_ppl_group_desc: "While carrying out his plan to improve the environment in Qinghai, Ma Bufang encountered massive misunderstanding of his ideas by the locals. Therefore, he proposes to set up special groups of teachers who will travel to the settlements and give lectures to eradicate illiteracy among the people."
 XSM_nice_roads_desc: "Because of its remoteness and because of its landscape, Qinghai continues to be a very backward region. Even the roads in our province are of terrible quality, so even cars have a hard time traveling on them."
 XSM_sanitar_project_desc: "One of the problems of the province is the occasional outbreaks of various infectious diseases that come usually from neighboring regions. We can't fight them for the time being due to underdeveloped medicine."
 XSM_medical_project_desc: "We have managed to deal with the sanitation problems, but to finally consolidate our successes in the medical field, we need new hospitals brought up to modern standards."
 XSM_industrial_desc: "Our areas have lagged behind other provinces in China, especially the coastal provinces where many foreigners are located and a lot of money flows. However, we can try to catch up by implementing small but ambitious development and reconstruction plans."
 XSM_education_projects_desc: "Bufan is a strong advocate of education development, requiring local businessmen to invest in modernizing and building schools."
 XSM_money_for_scholar_desc: "To improve the quality and accessibility of education in the province, Ma Bufan has decided to fund free uniforms and meals for all students in schools from the provincial budget."
 XSM_inegartion_blueshirts_ideas_desc: "Nanjing underwent a dramatic ideological change due to the underhanded struggle of the ruling factions within the Kuomintang. As the Republic of China moves deeper and deeper into the ideas of national revolution, we must reaffirm our adherence to this course and embrace the ideas of the Blue Shirt Society."
 XSM_agrarian_projects_desc: "Our province is not suffering from hunger yet, but there are still problems with food. This is mainly due to the lack of our own fertile land, which means we have to import basic food from other provinces."
 XSM_water_sinin_desc: "The capital of our province should have modern conveniences of life, including the basics like running water. Right now, the U.S. is an economic world leader, with such systems being actively built since the turn of the century."
 XSM_press_control_desc: "Unlike his predecessor, Ma Bufang cannot tolerate criticism of his actions, which is often spilled on the pages of newspapers. Because of this, many media outlets are threatened with closure if they don't change their editorial policies."
 XSM_clear_sinin_desc: "One of the features of China in recent years has been heavy street littering and filth on the streets of cities. Bufan has decided to radically combat this by requiring shopkeepers and land owners to control the cleanliness of their areas."
 XSM_build_school_desc: "One of Bufan's new education projects will be a plan to build secular schools in the major settlements of the controlled provinces."
 XSM_expedition_golog_desc: "Golog is our southern region, mostly populated by Tibetans. It belonged to Tibet until the last Sino-Tibetan war, and there are still Lhasa loyalists there. But overall, this highland region is perhaps one of the most backward in all of China, as there are still some tribal peoples there."
 XSM_licvidate_slavery_desc: "The former territories of Tibet under our control still have the backward orders of the feudal period, including slavery. In order to gain the trust of the local people, we will eliminate it."
 XSM_tibet_chinese_desc: "To finally break away from the northern territories of Tibet, we must carry out a campaign of «chineseization» of Tibetans. Eliminating slavery in these territories will help us do this, as people will trust our government."
 XSM_up_tibet_tibet_nalog_desc: "We should increase taxes on those residents who do not submit to our policy of «chineseization» in the southern territories under our control. It will be a measure of economic pressure on them."
 XSM_tibet_in_army_desc: "In order to further integrate the province's Tibetan population into society, Ma Bufang has decided to look into forming military units composed of Tibetans living under our government's control. This will reduce social tension as people will have the opportunity for career advancement."
 XSM_armory_from_pekyn_desc: "We have our own small representative office in Peking, now near the border with Japan and its controlled states. With the help of the head of our representative office, we can try to organize the purchase of weapons from the Japanese for the purpose of fighting against the communist armies."
 XSM_create_company_desc: "In order to effectively control the province's economy, Ma Bufan proposes the creation of a state-owned company that will monopolize all major industrial enterprises in the province. This is the same practice implemented by General Ma Hongkui in Ningxia province. It also reduces the possibility of political competition."
 XSM_prom_desc: "Our province is rich not only in industrial facilities, but also in mining companies of private owners, for the control of which Ma Bufang is going to create a special state corporation."
 XSM_animal_desc: "One of the most popular SMEs in our province is animal husbandry, which we should also take control of."
 XSM_bank_desc: "Many provincial governors are setting up banks under the control of the provincial government, also helping to control the provincial economy. We should also consider implementing this practice in Qinghai."
 XSM_pies_desc: "Ma Bufan has become famous as a rather cruel and harsh military leader. He likes to use the semblance of religious and mystical cults to raise the spirits of his fighters, thus creating a rigidly disciplined army of loyal soldiers who will fight to the last drop of blood."
 XSM_jihad_vs_JAP_desc: "In order to maximize the morale of the soldiers and appeal to patriotism, we can declare a jihad, or holy war, against Japan. Some Muslim religious leaders will help us in this endeavor."
 XSM_codex_for_soldiers_desc: ""
 XSM_fight_with_commy_desc: "The territory of our provinces is strategically important to the communists, as it can allow us to organize aid shipments to the Soviet area from the USSR. Our army must fight the Communist guerrillas as brutally as the Japanese invaders."
 XSM_elite_horse_desc: "The landscape of the territories under our control and on which we usually fight is ideal for the use of cavalry. In order to defeat the Japanese, we will create the best cavalry units in Asia, and our commanders have plenty of experience in such wars."
 XSM_hight_train_desc: ""
 XSM_field_for_sun_desc: "The years are rushing by, and now Ma Bufan has a son of his own, who has spent his entire life since birth near the theater of operations where his father fought. Army life and skills are already in his blood."
 XSM_mobilize_militia_desc: "To organize resistance to the communists, we must begin forming more units so that communist propaganda does not have time to spread to them."

 XSM_idea_gubernator_conflict: "Rivalry between governors"
 XSM_idea_gubernator_conflict_desc: "Although the civilian governor Ma Lin is the leader of the province, he already has Ma Bufan, a member of the younger generation of Muslim generals who is also the military governor, breathing down his neck. So far, we still have a chance to emerge from this conflict unscathed, but if we continue to do nothing, Bufan will take action"
 XSM_idea_muslim_salafit: "Confronting Muslim Sects - Salafism predominance"
 XSM_idea_muslim_salafit_desc: "Islam has many different internal currents, and while no politician has ever taken an interest in the issue before, the experienced governor Ma Lin decided to approach the issue wisely by funding one sect, the Yihewani, which promotes values favorable to the Chinese government: modernism, nationalism and secularism. However, this could not help but cause tension from other religious groups"

 xsm.1.t: "Power is a family affair"
 xsm.1.d: "Northwest China has long been inhabited by Chinese Muslims, Hui, Donggang and even Kazakhs. Consequently, during the Xinhai Revolution and its aftermath, several families of Ma Muslim generals managed to gain a foothold in power here. Each of the three provinces, Qinghai, Ningxia and Gansu, was controlled by a single clique, with power usually passed down through hereditary succession. However, in recent years, a series of events have disrupted this natural course of development. \nPower in Gansu was divided between the governors of Qinghai and Ningxia provinces after its last governor, Ma Zhongying, left for Xinjiang to establish his authority there. Qinghai Governor Ma Qi died in 1931 and his brother Ma Lin took power in the province. On the one hand, the elderly governor was able to keep power firmly in his hands and also helped the other Ma generals to unite together in the face of General Sun Dianyin's invasion. On the other hand, Lin is a man of the "previous" generation of Ma, which irritates some of the younger and ambitious generals. The main manifestation of this discontent has been Ma Bufang, the military governor of Qinghai, who over the past month has become actively involved in the internal politics of the provincial government, creating dual power in the province. In addition, Bufang is the son of Ma Qi, the nephew of the current governor Lin, which adds a special piquancy to the situation. \nBecause of this, Ma Lin needs to take some action to take over the chief representative of the next generation of generals, as many are already saying that Bufan will not stop at his goal of ascending to power in the province"
 xsm.1.a: "Fathers and children"
 xsm.2.t: "Good news from the northwest"
 xsm.2.d: "The Governor of Qinghai Province [XSM.GetLeader] has reaffirmed his commitment to our government by making cuts to his powers. This is exactly what we are forcefully seeking from the leaders of other cliques and provinces. It is a boon that local governors have long been known for their high loyalty to the central Chinese government. In exchange for reducing their powers, our experts have helped clean up the mess in the province's financial system, on top of including the province in the nationwide taxation system, sending some of it to Nanjing."
 xsm.2.a: "Wonderful news"
 xsm.3.t: "Yushu Batang Airport has been restored"
 xsm.3.d: "The Governor of Qinghai has restored Yushu Batang Airport in northern Tibet under his control. This has enabled us to bombard Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and consequently the local authorities will be more cooperative in negotiating with us."
 xsm.3.a: "Tibet will remain in our sphere of influence"
 xsm.4.t: "Rebuilding Yushu Batang Airport"
 xsm.4.d: "Recently, troops of local warlord Ma Bufang have reappeared near the Yushu Batang airfield destroyed during the Sino-Tibetan war and have been busy rebuilding the runway and airplane hangars. This action is a hint to us that the Republic of China continues to claim our territories and will not allow foreign armies here."
 xsm.4.a: "Now Yushu Batang is within easy reach of Lhasa"
 xsm.5.t: "Chinese troops at the border"
 xsm.5.d: "The Chinese army is massing at our borders. The governor of Qinghai Province [XSM.GetLeader] is trying to curry favor with his government by jeopardizing our independence. His army was heavily trained in the war with Tibet and later Japanese troops and communist guerrillas, so we need to think about peaceful solutions to the issue"
 xsm.5.a: "We need to keep that in mind"
 xsm.6.t: "Unification proposal"
 xsm.6.d: "The Governor of Qinghai [XSM.GetLeader] has put forward a proposal for us to unite our two cliques. This would help us maintain our strength and hold our own in the face of a powerful enemy, as well as keep the Muslims in general in control of these territories"
 xsm.6.a: "We agree"
 xsm.6.b: "We agree"
 xsm.6.c: "Autonomously we act more effectively"
 xsm.7.t: "Rejection of Ma clique leaders"
 xsm.7.d: "The leaders of the Ma clique have refused to unite with our clique, as they believe that it is because of our autonomous and independent actions in our own provinces that we have been able to fight and develop our regions so effectively. Accordingly, we should continue to adhere to this principle."
 xsm.7.a: "Good"
 xsm.8.t: "The Yihewani split"
 xsm.8.d: "As we began to directly finance the Yihewani Muslim sect, we demanded that it finally adopt modernist positions, but unfortunately this led to unexpected consequences: their unity turned out to be a fragile illusion, and the sect finally split into two currents: modernist and traditional. \nConsequently, the predominance of backward forms of Islam over modernist ideas reappeared, as the Salafis could not help but take advantage of such a fortunate situation."
 xsm.8.a: "It seems time to move to radical measures"
 xsm.9.t: "Personal conversation between governors"
 xsm.9.d: "The Ma families deal with issues of power control in a fairly simple way: they expand their sphere of influence to get a new piece of land that can be handed over to a young and ambitious general. This is how the Ma's expanded their holdings south to the Tibetan Plateau and north to the border of Outer Mongolia. It was for this purpose that Ma Zhongying and his 36th Division traveled to Xinjiang to become the local ruler. \nMa Lin, sensing the growing power ambitions of his nephew Ma Bufan, decided to use this plan once again. Since Bufan is an excellent military commander and had already proved his abilities in the military conflict with Tibet in 1932, Lin suggested that he organize a military expedition there to restore the authority of the Chinese Republic over these territories. In addition, we have two candidates for Tibetan power that Bufang can "support" in his campaign: a young child, who is considered a potential 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, and the legitimate co-ruler of Tibet, Panchen Lama IX, who was gotten rid of by the local aristocracy a few years ago and traveled to China. He now lives in our province, in Xining, and has long sought to regain his rightful power in Tibet. \nBufan likes Lin's idea and has already begun to prepare an army to do so, but we still need to choose who to use as the puppet ruler of Tibet."
 xsm.9.a: "Let's go with Dalai Lama XIV"
 xsm.9.b: "Bet on Panchen Lama IX"
 xsm.10.t: "Muslim invasion"
 xsm.10.d: "Muslim generals from northwest China have decided to renew the conflict of five years ago and try to finally eliminate our independence. General Ma Bufan of the Qinghai clique has invaded Tibetan territory in the north, demanding submission to the authority of the supposedly new reincarnation of Dalai Lama XIV, a gutless and juvenile boy who is a puppet in Bufan's hands. Some of our territories have already defected to Bufang's side, believing in the truth of the Dalai Lama's reincarnation, but we still have most of the country under our control."
 xsm.10.a: "We must stop them or Tibet will fall under Chinese influence again"
 xsm.10.b: "Long live Dalai Lama XIV!"
 xsm.11.t: "Invasion of the Panchen Lama"
 xsm.11.d: "Expelled from the country, Panchen Lama IX has been wandering all over China for a long time, seeking support from one of the rulers of a country or province near Tibet. And now he has finally managed to enlist the military power of Muslim generals in northwest China to restore his rule in Lhasa. However, he does not realize that he will only be a puppet in the hands of the ruthless Muslim militarists. Some of our territories have defected to the Panchen Lama's side, believing in the sincerity of his statements, but the capital remains under our control."
 xsm.11.a: "The Panchen Lama is a traitor to Tibet interests"
 xsm.11.b: "Finally a legitimate ruler"
 xsm.12.t: "Ma Lin's retirement"
 xsm.12.d: "Provincial Governor Ma Lin has completed his political journey. He has finished all the deeds and reforms he was going to do in his office. These were the words he conveyed to the leadership of the republic in a telephone conversation. As his successor, he nominated General Ma Pu, a proven man and loyal associate of Ma Linh. The leadership approved him for the post."
 xsm.12.a: "Thank Lin for everything"
 xsm.13.t: "Defeat of the Tibetan campaign"
 xsm.13.d: "General Ma Bufang returned from Tibet with a heavy defeat. Through an amazingly fortunate coincidence, the Tibetan army troops managed to defeat the select units of Bufang and his brother Buqin, after which they retreated back to the territories under our control. \nOn the one hand, our plan has failed, we have not expanded our zone of influence, and Ma Bufang cannot be sent to Tibet to rule. But on the other hand, having suffered such a serious defeat at the hands of such a weak enemy and having lost all of his loyal army, Bufang will now be unable to pressure us, so the position of governor remains safe."
 xsm.13.a: "Fortune hath not been happy, but misfortune hath helped."
 xsm.14.t: "Changes in the provincial government"
 xsm.14.d: "The director of the provincial transportation bureau, Ma Zuo, is one of the oldest members of the government, dating back to the reign of Ma Bufang's father, Ma Qi. He was appointed by him in 1929. Since then, Ma Zuo has also become known as a major businessman who owns most of the province's salt mines. \nIt was his removal by Bufang that was one of the most anticipated after the latter's announcement to reform the government. Along with Ma Zuo, several other low-influence supporters of Ma Lin left their posts."
 xsm.14.a: "We need new, young people"
 xsm.15.t: "Purges in the officer corps"
 xsm.15.d: "In addition to purging Ma Lin's supporters from the provincial government, Ma Bufan has taken up a review of the top officers. He realizes that there are many who may want to use his own experience in gaining power in the province through military pressure, so it is worth it to secure his position by removing unreliable people from the army. \nTo make it not look like a real fight against dissent, then those people will get decent but non-influential positions in the government and rear military services."
 xsm.15.a: "We don't need their influence"
 xsm.16.t: "Ma Zuo's suspicious activities"
 xsm.16.d: "More than six months ago we dismissed Ma Zuo, a businessman who owns salt mines in Qinghai, from his government post. Since then, his business affairs have been even better than during his time in government office. His main company moved to Linxia City in Gansu Province, and he himself began setting up many stores and businesses across China, including keeping his assets in Qinghai as well."
 xsm.16.a: "There may be corruption involved"
 xsm.17.t: "Ma Zuo's new company"
 xsm.17.d: "Ma Zuo continues his entrepreneurial activism. This time it was reported that he has established Deyiheng Company in Xining and opened several stores where he sells his goods produced in Gansu or mined here in Qinghai. Yet his business empire continues to expand into other provinces, stretching from Tibet to Beijing. Apparently, he still managed to make some very good connections while he was in his position in our provincial government, so it's time to formally accuse him."
 xsm.17.a: "Corruption, official swagger..."
 xsm.18.t: "Nationalization of Ma Zuo's enterprises"
 xsm.18.d: "Today, our provincial court officially handed down corruption charges against a former member of the provincial government, Ma Zuo, who has recently received much attention from Governor Ma Bufang because of his too rapid growth of personal wealth in the form of enterprises, stores and new firms that are springing up not only in Qinghai but have already spread from India to Beijing. Due to the allegations, Ma Bufan decided to nationalize the salt mines and some of Ma Zuo's stores located directly in Xining, the provincial capital. \It had long since become clear to Ma Zuo himself that he was better off staying out of Qinghai altogether after Bufang became the unrestricted local ruler."
 xsm.18.a: "Ma Zuo is who?"
 xsm.19.t: "Zhang Daqian's return"
 xsm.19.d: "The Chinese artist Zhang Daqian, whom we sent to the Tibetan city of Skubum to recruit researchers and assistants to join his team, has returned to Xining again, and then to begin work on analyzing and copying Dunhuang Buddhist art for the museums of China."
 xsm.19.a: "Glorious"
 xsm.20.t: "Meeting with Wang Luobin"
 xsm.20.d: “A shabby young man arrived at the residence in Xining with a harmonica in his hand, which he almost never left. At the threshold, he was personally greeted by the owner, the majestic Ma Bufang, and escorted into the living room, where they were served tea. Bufang asked Wang about his life, he told him that he had recently graduated from the Faculty of Music of Beijing Normal University and had been fond of Chinese folk songs since childhood.In his story, he also mentioned that the Japanese behave very inappropriately in Beijing and “feel like masters of the situation.” \nBufang hesitated a little, as he did not want to talk about politics at the moment. He was more interested in Wang's knowledge of folk music, they had a long conversation on this topic, Wang said that he had long been collecting various works throughout China that seemed interesting to him. At the end of the conversation, Bufan promised to help Wang financially in exchange for writing songs to maintain the morale of his fighters."
 xsm.20.a: "With such conversations you forget about tea and war"
 xsm.21.t: "The arrest of Wang Luobin"
 xsm.21.d: “We have received news that the police have arrested and are holding in prison the musician Wang Luobin, with whom we established close cooperation about a year ago. The exact reasons for the arrest are not reported, but it seems like some kind of misunderstanding. Considering our situation and our connections, we should intervene in the ongoing outrage and call the young musician out of prison."
 xsm.21.a: "One call will help him"
 xsm.22.t: "Misunderstanding"
 xsm.22.d: "Musician Wang Luobin again visited the residence of the military leader Ma Bufang. He arrived to tell the story of his misadventure, during which he ended up in prison. It turned out that during his next creative search, the local police accepted him either "for a homeless person, or for a Japanese spy, which is why she was arrested. Wang thanked Bufan for his release and said that he was ready to continue working for him at any time."
 xsm.22.a: "And this happens"
 xsm.23.t: "Complete filming"
 xsm.23.d: “The filming of the film, financed personally by Ma Bufang, took place in Qinghai for several months. Many famous Chinese film figures took part in the project: directors, actors, screenwriters. Bufang’s longtime acquaintance, Wang Luobin, also did not avoid the opportunity to participate in the production and wrote the song “In this place, very far away” for the film."
 xsm.23.a: "The film will definitely be successful"
 xsm.24.t: "Song of the War Horse"
 xsm.24.d: "The Chinese musician Wang Luobin wrote a war horse song specially commissioned by the military leader Ma Bufang, inspired by the successes of the troops of Muslim generals in northwestern China. In order to personally perform his work, Wang arrived at Bufang's residence in Xining. "
 xsm.24.a: "This will improve the morale of our soldiers"
 xsm.25.t: "March of Chinese Muslims"
 xsm.25.d: "The Chinese musician Wang Luobin wrote a march of Chinese Muslims specifically commissioned by the warlord Ma Bufang, inspired by the successes of the troops of Muslim generals in northwestern China and the call for a holy war against Japan. In order to personally perform his work, Wang arrived to Bufan's residence in Xining."
 xsm.25.a: "This will improve the morale of our soldiers"
 xsm.26.t: "Opening of a secular school for girls"
 xsm.26.d: "Ma Bufang decided to use his personal example to prove his commitment to the development of education, as well as the expansion of women's rights. Together with his wife, in recent months they have been investing in the construction of a secular school for girls in the city of Linxia. Today at its opening they were personally present, which raised Bufan's popularity even higher among ordinary people. “Other major financial owners should follow this example,” the head of the province concluded his speech at the opening."
 xsm.26.a: "A worthy deed"
 xsm.27.t: "Opening of the Tibetan school"
 xsm.27.d: “Ma Bufang prefers to use the idea of “carrot and stick” to Sinicize the Tibetan population of the southern regions of Qinghai Province. After another punitive operation in that area, a school for Tibetans was opened in one of the large settlements, built with money provinces."
 xsm.27.a: "That's a good idea"
 xsm.28.t: "Tibetan Rebellion"
 xsm.28.d: "After we imposed additional taxes on Tibetans who are unwilling to undergo the "Chinatization" program, there has been massive dissatisfaction among the people in the southern regions with the new measures. They continue to ignore the Chineseization program, and tensions in the region are rising. The population of these provinces began to evade paying taxes in principle, and clashes between the population and tax collectors began to occur. Several people on both sides have suffered, and yesterday the point of no return was reached: the Tibetans revolted in the southern regions of Qinghai under our control."
 xsm.28.a: "They didn't want "Chineseization"? Then they'll get a 'suppression campaign'!"
 xsm.29.t: "Rebellion in Qinghai"
 xsm.29.d: "After the Chinese warlord Ma Bufang, who occupied our northern provinces, began forcing local Tibetans to carry out "Chineseization" and also imposed increased taxes on them, the disgruntled local people decided to revolt against Bufang's brazen actions. We can try to organize secret aid to the rebels in the form of arms and equipment."
 xsm.29.a: "It will be a little help, but help"
 xsm.29.b: "We don't have the means to do so"
 xsm.30.t: "Growing rebellion"
 xsm.30.d: "In our southern regions, the local population continues to rise up. They are arming themselves, probably due to their proximity to Tibet, and trying to do battle with our troops. It looks like we won't be able to just deal with them."
 xsm.30.a: "In a strategic perspective, they don't stand a chance."
 xsm.32.t: "Defeat of the rebellion"
 xsm.32.d: "The uprising in the southern regions of the Qinghai Ma clique ended in failure. It was brutally suppressed by the warlords of the Ma Dynasty, and the area where it happened is now strewn with corpses and soaked in blood."
 xsm.32.a: "A presumptuous attempt"
 xsm.32.b: "A presumptuous attempt"
 xsm.33.t: "Victory of rebellion"
 xsm.33.d: "After prolonged fighting, the rebellion in the southern Qinghai Ma clique has gotten out of the control of the local Ma warlord and the rebels have managed to drive his troops from the mountain slopes back to the Qinghai plateau. Now the rebels are going to appeal to the Tibetan government to restore their control over them."
 xsm.33.a: "Let them just try..."
 xsm.33.b: "Our lands are finally coming back to us"
 xsm.33.c: "This may cause a new Sino-Tibetan war"
 xsm.34.t: "Tibet has taken rebel territories"
 xsm.34.d: "Tibetan troops and officials have returned to the territory where the local people recently rebelled. We have been defeated by them, but such insolence on the part of the Tibetan government is astounding. On the other hand, they consider it their legitimate territory and the local people are loyal to them. The question arises whether it is worth trying to hold this land for us."
 xsm.34.a: "We will defend them by force"
 xsm.34.b: "Let them take them"
 xsm.35.t: "A new China-Tibetan war"
 xsm.35.d: "In northern Tibet, in the area under the control of the Qinghai Ma clique, battles broke out again between General Ma Bufang's troops and the Tibetan government. The escalation of the conflict happened because of a Tibetan uprising in that region, after which Tibet decided to protect the lives of its citizens in the territory they consider occupied by Bufang during the last Sino-Tibetan war. We too remain frozen territorial disputes with Tibet, so we should try to support the Muslim generals."
 xsm.35.a: "Yes, we are going to war"
 xsm.35.b: "This is not a good time to go to war with Tibet"
 xsm.36.t: "The rebels are holding out"
 xsm.36.d: "In our southern regions, the local rebel population continues their resistance. It's worth noting that we've managed to surround them near the settlement of Golog, so we only need to make one more "expedition" into it to defeat the rebel Tibetans."
 xsm.36.a: "Great news"
 xsm.37.t: "Ma Boufan's Pies"
 xsm.37.d: "Ma Bufan walked out to a line of soldiers on a makeshift platz in a military camp. He first walked carefully along them, peering into each one's eyes, then stood in the center in front of them. His assistant brought him a tray, on which stood a plate with a pie and a glass filled with some red liquid. The officers who were watching this whispered, but Bufan glared at them and they immediately fell silent. \Brothers... - he turned to the formation, - I once studied to be an Imam, and when I had to change my occupation to military life, my teacher gave me his last advice: After you kill your enemy, take a piece of bread, - Boufan took a cake from the plate, - sprinkle it with the enemy's blood and you will be full, - Boufan dipped the cake into the glass with that red liquid and ate it to the last crumb in complete silence. \nIt was the blood of one of the communist guerrillas that swarm our province. Now you are all my students, so I'm passing this advice on to you. - Bufan finished his speech, after which one of the officers behind his back fainted."
 xsm.37.a: "An impressive sight"
 xsm.38.t: "A tense conversation between the brothers"
 xsm.38.d: "Ma Bufan had long thought that he had rid himself of any political competition within the clique and the province by removing Ma Lin as civilian governor and later purging the government and top officers. However, trouble came when he didn't expect it: his own brother Ma Buqing, probably backed by the government of the Republic, joined us in an underground confrontation for the leadership of the province. \nAccording to the information we have received, the leadership of the country wants the one of the two generals who can win more battles to be the new leader."
 xsm.38.a: "And you, Buqin?!"
 xsm.39.t: "Bufan holds the power in his hands"
 xsm.39.d: "General Ma Bufan has managed to prove his skills and dedication to leading the country through a large number of victories in battles against our enemies. Accordingly, Ma Buqing has lost the trust of the leaders of the Republic and there is nothing to stop Bufan from removing him from his competing positions, replacing him with more loyal men than his own brother."
 xsm.39.a: "A brother is a big man in Sinin?!"
 xsm.40.t: "Bufan has been removed from his post"
 xsm.40.d: "The leadership of the Republic has sent its decision on the issue of leadership in our province. The current governor, Ma Bufan, is stepping down from his top post and his sibling Ma Buqing will take his place. This is reportedly due to the great confidence Buqin has in him as he has managed to accomplish many resplendent victories in recent years."
 xsm.40.a: "You are my brother..."
 xsm.41.t: "Ma Bufan's Rebellion"
 xsm.41.d: "General Ma Bufan has rebelled with the help of loyal troops. He opposed our decision to support an alternative government, as he himself is personally loyal to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Nanking government.\n Bufan was supported by several other top officers with their units, posing a strong threat to our government. However, since we have support from the armies of other provinces, we should be able to suppress this rebellion fairly quickly."
 xsm.41.a: "It is necessary to suppress them while they are surrounded"
 xsm.41.b: "We will not allow the communist contagion to spread"
 xsm.42.t: "Death of Ma Lin"
 xsm.42.d: "At a rather advanced age, especially for our realities of an almost constantly ongoing civil war, Ma Lin, one of the most important men in the history of the province, having been its leader during the most difficult periods in the history of the northwest, has passed away"
 xsm.42.a: "Thank him for that"
 xsm.42.b: "He has a worthy successor"
 xsm.43.t: "Governor's conflict intensifies"
 xsm.43.d: "The competition between Bufang and Lin continues to grow. Lin is unwilling to put anyone on an equal footing with himself, which greatly unnerves Bufan, who is gradually trying to find ways to "get rid" of his uncle. Of course, we are talking about purely legal and soft variants of such disposal. \n Generals and the provincial government are gradually joining one or another side of the conflict, but if earlier Ma Lin was very popular among them, now more and more people choose Bufang as a future contender for the role of the clique leader. Ma Lin has less and less chance of retaining his power."
 xsm.43.a: "To do this, we must go to extreme measures"
 xsm.44.t: "Ma Bufang makes his demands"
 xsm.44.d: "Today, the long-running conflict between the military and civilian governor reached its peak: after another dispute in the government between Ma Lin and Ma Bufan over yet another trivial matter, the latter set his own conditions for the government's work, without which he and a group of supporting generals will not fulfill their duties.\n Ma Lin was hoping for the support of his loyal group of officers and cabinet members, but suddenly almost all of them defected to Bufan's side. It hit Linh incredibly hard, he felt sick, slowly sat down in his chair and after several minutes of complete silence in the cabinet, he finally uttered his answer: \n - I will think about this proposal. Now I'll ask to be left alone. All the spectators of this performance walked out of Ma Lin's office where the meeting was held. With closed eyes and heavy tired breathing, he sat in the same place. He realized that accepting Lin's proposals meant de facto stripping him of his power. And even if he sought support from the central government, it would no longer be possible to work in such an environment."
 xsm.44.a: "Lin needs a vacation. On a pilgrimage, to his aunt, to the wilderness, to Mecca."
 xsm.45.t: "Ma Lin's call"
 xsm.45.d: "The Governor of Qinghai Province, Ma Lin, today made a call to Nanjing, where he informed the government of the Republic that he could no longer fulfill his duties for health reasons and wished to resign. As his successor, Lin proposed young General Ma Bufan, who has been military governor of the province for several years.\n The resignation was accepted, and Bufan became the new all-powerful governor of Qinghai Province."
 xsm.45.a: "A good retirement for Lin"
 xsm.45.b: "Good pension to Linyu"
 xsm.46.t: "Fate of Tibet"
 xsm.46.d: "We have completely gained control of the territories of Tibet. It will be quite difficult to rule them directly from Sinin, so it makes sense for us to set up a local government there headed by one of the generals of our clique."
 xsm.46.a: "We will"
 xsm.46.b: "We will"
 xsm.47.t: "The fate of Xinjiang"
 xsm.47.d: "We have completely gained control of the territories of Xinjiang. It will be quite difficult to rule them directly from Xining, so it makes sense for us to set up a local government there headed by one of our clique's generals"
 xsm.47.a: "We will"
 xsm.47.b: "We will"
