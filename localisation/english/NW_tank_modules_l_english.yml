 EQ_MOD_CAT_tank_coatings_TITLE:0 "Coating"
 tank_camouflage_net:0 "Camouflage Nets"
 tank_camouflage_net_desc:0 "It is widely used to mask weapons, military equipment and engineering structures against the background of the terrain, vegetation cover from various enemy reconnaissance methods."
 tank_camouflage_paint:0 "Camouflage"
 tank_camouflage_paint_desc:0 "The color difference of a military object from the surrounding background is the main and primary unmasking feature of this object. The smaller this difference, the more difficult it is to notice such an object on the ground."
 tank_zimmerit:0 "Zimmerit"
 tank_zimmerit_desc:0 "Paste-like coating used on mid and late-war German armored fighting vehicles. Used to produce a hard layer covering the metal armor of the vehicle, providing enough separation that magnetically attached anti-tank mines would fail to stick to the vehicle."
 
 EQ_MOD_CAT_tank_ammo_TITLE:0 "Shells"
 tank_ammo_armour_piercing_discarding_sabot:0 "Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot"
 tank_ammo_armour_piercing_discarding_sabot_desc:0 "Additional armor-piercing sub-caliber ammunition.\nThey are designed to hit heavily armored objects, particularly tanks. As a rule, such a projectile has neither a fuse nor an explosive charge. Its armor penetrating effect is entirely due to the kinetic energy of the projectile."
 tank_high_explosive_anti_tank:0 "High-explosive Anti-Tank"
 tank_high_explosive_anti_tank_desc:0 "Additional high-explosive anti-tank ammunition.\nThey are designed to shoot at armored targets as well as at reinforced concrete fortifications. The penetration effect is achieved not by the kinetic energy of the projectile, but by the energy of the cumulative jet produced by the detonation of an explosive of a certain shape at a certain distance from the armor."
 
 
 tank_low_noise_exhaust_system:0 "Low-Noise Exhaust System"
 tank_low_noise_exhaust_system_desc:0 "Increases the stealth of the tank. Useful for active reconnaissance as well as for passive observation from more risky positions."
 tank_stereo_tube:0 "Stereo Spyglass"
 tank_stereo_tube_desc:0 "Good visibility gives an important advantage in combat."
 tank_improved_turning_mechanisms:0 "Improved Roataion Mechanisms"
 tank_improved_turning_mechanisms_desc:0 "Increases hull and turret rotation speed for tanks with a turret or gun speed for vehicles with a fixed turret."
 tank_additional_ground_hooks:0 "Additional Grousers"
 tank_additional_ground_hooks_desc:0 "Increases the turning speed of the machine, as well as saving the accumulated speed when crossing all types of surfaces."
 tank_manual_fire_extinguisher:0 "Fire Extinguisher"
 tank_manual_fire_extinguisher_desc:0 "Being able to put out the resulting fire may give the tank a second chance."
 tank_repair_kit:0 "Extended Repair Kit"
 tank_repair_kit_desc:0 "The possibility of rapid repair by the crew greatly increases the survivability of the tank."
 tank_hardening_of_armor:0 "Armor Hardening"
 tank_hardening_of_armor_desc:0 "The ability of steel to change its properties after hardening is its most important feature. Quenching is what makes steel so different from iron in its physical characteristics: intense heating and then abrupt cooling significantly increases the hardness of armor steel, but it is quite a hard technological process."
 tank_carburizing_steel:0 "Carburizing Steel"
 tank_carburizing_steel_desc:0 "Surface diffusion saturation of steel with carbon to increase hardness, wear resistance."
