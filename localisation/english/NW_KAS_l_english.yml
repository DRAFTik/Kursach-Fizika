 KAS_governor_liu_ping: "Governor Liu Bing"
 KAS_governor_liu_ping_desc: "Appointed two years ago to replace the Uyghur Mahmud Muhithi, the new governor, a Manchurian by nationality and a communist by political preference, has adopted a strict anti-religious and educational policy that has greatly alarmed the local population. Through his actions, he is trying to integrate Kashgar into Xinjiang."
 KAS_atheism_propaganda_program: "Promote atheism"
 KAS_atheism_propaganda_program_desc: "One of the areas in which Communist Liu Bing works is the promotion of atheism and secularism. Perhaps his actions are turning the local population against the new government rather than trying to integrate the region into Xinjiang."
 KAS_educational_reforms: "Reform the education system"
 KAS_educational_reforms_desc: "In addition to promoting atheism, Liu Bing is trying to introduce education in the provinces as instructed by his Soviet advisers. However, some innovations irritate the local population: for example, instead of studying the Quran, Uyghurs have begun to take a course in military training."
 KAS_agitation_among_uighur_soldiers: "Spread agitation among Uyghur soldiers"
 KAS_agitation_among_uighur_soldiers_desc: "The Uyghur soldiers under Mahmud Muhithi are still a very dangerous force that can throw off Sheng Shitcai's power in the province. By sensitising them, we may be able to draw some of them to our side."
 KAS_training_with_the_assistance_of_soviet_specialists: "Train with the help of Soviet socialists"
 KAS_training_with_the_assistance_of_soviet_specialists_desc: "Soviet military instructors are based in Kashgar and visit military camps to train soldiers. Soviet instructors also teach in schools, as we are woefully short of our own specialists."
 KAS_land_redistribution: "Redistribute the land"
 KAS_land_redistribution_desc: "In order to gain the support of the local population, some land would be given to them for cultivation. This is contrary to Bolshevik ideology, but will allow them to retain power in the province."
 KAS_refurbishment_of_mosques: "Renovate mosques"
 KAS_refurbishment_of_mosques_desc: "Kashgar has a severe shortage of public facilities like hospitals or schools, but we have few mosques. Liu Ping believes that converting some of the mosques, as well as the areas next to them, will not upset the local population too much."
 KAS_building_schools: "Build schools"
 KAS_building_schools_desc: "A large number of schools are needed to promote mass education in the province. Both provincial bodies and independent associations are engaged in their establishment."
 KAS_closure_of_muslim_schools_and_madrassas: "Close Muslim schools and madrasas"
 KAS_closure_of_muslim_schools_and_madrassas_desc: "In pursuing secularisation and promoting atheism, Liu Bing decided to get rid of Muslim schools and madrasas because the instructions they proving are too religious."
 KAS_joining_xinjiang: "Become part of Xinjiang"
 KAS_joining_xinjiang_desc: "The ultimate goal of Liu Bing's tenure as governor of Kashgar is to incorporate the rest of Xinjiang to complete the final centralisation of the province."

 KAS_heart_of_eurasia_idea: "The Heart of Eurasia"
 KAS_heart_of_eurasia_idea_desc: "Xinjiang may be called the heart of Eurasia, but these beautiful words hide the extreme backwardness of the region, which is literally very difficult to reach from almost all developed centres of the world - all this is primarily due to its geographical location and landscape: Xinjiang is cut off from neighbouring countries by mountains, and a huge part of its territory is occupied by the Taklamakan desert. All this has led to the fact that life in this region is concentrated in just a dozen cities, while the rest of the area is uninhabited wasteland."
 KAS_uighur_nationalism_idea: "Uyghur nationalism"
 KAS_uighur_nationalism_idea_desc: "The genie of national uprisings, released from the bottle in 1931 in Xinjiang by the then governor, may never be brought back - it was an inevitable process, not the misguided actions of a particular individual. However, of all the peoples inhabiting Xinjiang, the most problematic are the Uyghurs - for the simple enough reason that they make up the majority of its population. However, of course, we should take into account the fact that ordinary residents of Kashgar, Kuldja, Turpan, Qumul and other cities do not yet feel themselves part of a single nation, and depending on what state policy regarding nationalities will be implemented in the coming years will depend on the outcome of the formation of the Uyghurs as a nation and the outcome of the confrontation in the province."
 KAS_illiterate_population_idea: "Illiterate Population"
 KAS_illiterate_population_idea_desc: "So far, the majority of the population of the province does not even have basic literacy, but most of the Uyghur politicians are trying to solve this issue at the moment - they are developing a system of accessible education, in parallel trying to control "people's minds" in this way. This is all a clear legacy of Jadidism, a project of Islamic modernism that was born in the late 19th century in the Russian Empire and almost died after its collapse."
 KAS_poorly_educated_population_idea: "Poorly Educated Population"
 KAS_towards_universal_education_idea: "Towards Universal Education"
 KAS_seasonal_labor_migration_in_the_ussr_idea: "Seasonal Labour Migration in the USSR"
 KAS_seasonal_labor_migration_in_the_ussr_idea_desc: "An important role in the economy of Kashgar is played by seasonal labour migration of the poorest sections of the local population to the Soviet Union - mainly to Tashkent, where they can find work. Over time, this practice has become a whole sphere of life for some people - those who organise it. The problem is that the process is led by the richest sections of the population of Kashgar, who do not care about the condition of those who are willing to work for them - people are sent to Tashkent as if they were slaves or prisoners, living in terrible conditions, and since the Soviet Union looks the other way, the population of Kashgar forms a sharply negative image of the "Bolshevik government", under which in reality no reforms take place and the condition of the local "proletariat and peasants" is kept at a monstrously poor level.."

 NW_KAS_news.0.t: "[GetNewsHeadline]The Second Republic of East Turkistan"
 NW_KAS_news.0.d: "The indigenous Uyghurs came to power in the now apparently former Chinese province of Xinjiang. During long, bloody battles, they managed to expel all rivals from the province, despite the fact that they were backed by powerful outside forces, be it the next government of China or the Soviet Union. The leader of the uprising, Mahmud Muhiti, today announced the proclamation of a new Turkic Islamic Republic of East Turkestan. New, because a few years earlier, in 1933, a similar government had already been proclaimed here, in which Muhiti himself took part."
 NW_KAS_news.0.a: "Another nation freed from the colonisers?"
 NW_KAS_news.0.b: "You can die, but you can't turn back"
 NW_KAS_news.0.c: "Well, it won't be for long."
 NW_KAS_news.1.t: "[GetNewsHeadline]Proclamation of the Kingdom of Islamistan"
 NW_KAS_news.1.d: "The indigenous Uyghurs came to power in the now apparently former Chinese province of Xinjiang. During long, bloody battles, they managed to oust all rivals from the province despite the fact that they were backed by powerful outside forces, be it another Chinese government or the Soviet Union. The leader of the uprising, Mahmoud Muhiti, today announced the proclamation of the Kingdom of Islamistan. This was perhaps the most unexpected outcome of the confrontation in this remote corner of civilization, as the Uyghurs decided to invite to the throne a British aristocrat, Khalid Sheldrake, who converted to Islam in the late 20s and began to popularize it in his homeland."
 NW_KAS_news.1.a: "A British Aristocrat is the King of the Uyghurs?"
 NW_KAS_news.1.b: "He will help us internationally"
 NW_KAS_news.1.c: "London's influence is clearly involved"
 
 NW_KAS.0.t: "The Assassination of the Chief Qadi of Kashgar."
 NW_KAS.0.d: "A heinous crime happened in Kashgar today - an unknown poor man killed the city's chief qadi, Justice Abdullahgafur Damollah. Despite the fact that the murder was by a completely as yet unknown person, it seems to be just the tip of the iceberg - a major confrontation in Kashgar, dragging on for months now, between Liu Bing's administration and Mahmud Muhithi's National Assembly. The latter has used the New Life newspaper as the main ideological organ of the assembly. Late last year, one of Khoja Niyaz's closest aides, Mansour Ef-Endi, arrived from Urumqi to try to seize control of the Uyghur Education Association's finances. The first round of this confrontation was then won by Mahmud, retaining control of the association. Mansur then decided to go the other way and got his own man, a Chinese communist, appointed as the new editor-in-chief of New Life, thus effectively neutralizing this instrument of Muhithi's struggle. In this he was greatly assisted by Abdullahgafur Damollah. Despite his status as a Qadi, an Islamic Sharia judge, he was considered close to the Communists and their leader, Qadir Haji. In all likelihood, his murder was an act of revenge."
 NW_KAS.0.a: "He was a valuable resource at Liu Bing's disposal"
 NW_KAS.1.t: "Xinjiang Explosion"
 NW_KAS.1.d: "What had happened was what the new provincial authorities had been trying to avoid for so long: the steadfast Uyghurs had risen again. So far, they had only seized power in their province of Kashgar. Mahmud Muhiti became the head of the rebellion."
 NW_KAS.1.a: "Uyghurs will be free!"
 NW_KAS.1.b: "It was to be expected..."
 NW_KAS.2.t: "Abdullah Niyaz is rebelling"
 NW_KAS.2.d: "The Duban of Xinjiang, Sheng Shiсai, invited Mahmud Muhiti, commander of the 6th Division, to the Third Provincial People's Congress as the leader of the Uyghur population. Mahmud Muhiti realized how this could end for him and decided it was time to act. He ordered his deputy, Abdullah Niyaz, to raise the rebellion, and went to India to seek support from the British and Chinese governments, promising to return in a year. If he had a place to return to, of course..."
 NW_KAS.2.a: "Uyghurs will be free!"
 NW_KAS.3.t: "The Uyghur Uprising"
 NW_KAS.3.d: "What had happened was what the new provincial authorities had been trying to avoid for so long: the steadfast Uyghurs had risen again. So far, they have only seized power in their province of Kashgar. Abdullah Niyaz, deputy commander of the 6th Division, became the head of the rebellion. The whereabouts of the division commander, Mahmud Muhiti, are unknown."
 NW_KAS.3.a: "It was to be expected..."
 NW_KAS.4.t: "Muhiti Appeals to Us for Help"
 NW_KAS.4.d: "Uyghur leader Mahmud Muhiti, who had recently escaped from Xinjiang to India, could not find support from the Chinese authorities and turned to us for help. As we suspected, the local duban Sheng Shicai has essentially handed over power to the USSR representatives. They are destroying the local religion and trying to establish total control over the province. Muhiti reported that the Uyghur garrison is woefully short of weapons and finances to fight Soviet influence."
 NW_KAS.4.a: "We are ready to allocate weapons from warehouses and help with finances"
 NW_KAS.4.b: "We have no interest in this"
 NW_KAS.5.t: "The Arrival of the Uyghur Leader"
 NW_KAS.5.d: "In China's Xinjiang province, the Uyghur uprising has once again begun. One of the local leaders of the uprising, Mahmud Muhiti, has traveled to Kabul to request our support in the form of weapons and money, which his rebel soldiers in Kashgar are lacking."
 NW_KAS.5.a: "We will support them"
 NW_KAS.5.b: "We have no interest in this"
 NW_KAS.6.t: "The Last Chance"
 NW_KAS.6.d: "The command of the 6th Uyghur Division has revolted in Kashgar against Sheng's rule. Once we may have been adversaries with them, but now we all have a common enemy - Sheng Shicai and his Bolshevik sponsors and aides, who clearly have the strength to definitely smash us all one by one. So our only chance is to unite and try to knock Sheng out of Urumqi and the rest of the province."
 NW_KAS.6.a: "We will support them!"
 NW_KAS.6.b: "We will remain loyal to Sheng"
 NW_KAS.7.t: "Muhiti's return with the British"
 NW_KAS.7.d: "Our leader Mahmud Muhiti has finally returned from his journey through India to China to seek support from the government of the Republic of China. However, he could not get urgent help from the Nanking politicians, so he started looking for other parties interested in our support. On the other hand, British politicians offered their assistance to Muhiti while traveling through India."
 NW_KAS.7.a: "That's very good news."
 NW_KAS.8.t: "A Letter to the Consul in India"
 NW_KAS.8.d: "Our consul in India received a letter from the Uyghur leader, Mahmud Muhiti. He described in detail the situation in Xinjiang. As we suspected, the local duban Sheng Shicai has essentially handed over power to the USSR representatives. They are destroying the local religion and trying to establish total control over the province. Muhithi assured the consul that the Uyghurs obey the Nanjing government, but ask to be protected from the attacks of the Bolsheviks and Sheng Shicai. They themselves are ready to defend their homeland, but they are woefully short of weapons to do so."
 NW_KAS.8.a: "It is urgent to equip the Muhiti expedition"
 NW_KAS.8.b: "There's nothing we can do..."
 NW_KAS.9.t: "Mahmud Muhiti Crossed the Border."
 NW_KAS.9.d: "The Uyghur national uprising in China's Xinjiang province has begun again, but one of the Uyghur leaders, Mahmud Muhiti, along with his brother and 19 officers, crossed the border into India and arrived in the city of Leh. There he stated that he intended to reach Calcutta to meet with the Chinese Consul General."
 NW_KAS.9.a: "We'll be watching him"
 NW_KAS.10.t: "Mongolian Population"
 NW_KAS.10.d: "The territory of our republic is inhabited not only by various Muslim peoples, but also, for example, by a small group of Mongolian Buddhists. They even have their own prince, who is the traditional head of the area where they live. The number of Mongols themselves does not exceed a couple hundred thousand people, but the very fact of their presence on our territory can be used by various Mongolian governments to justify raids or a full-fledged war with us. In this regard, some members of our Government propose to deal decisively with this population. The proposals are to evict them to the territory of Outer Mongolia or to negotiate with the Mongolian government."
 NW_KAS.10.a: "Let them stay where they are"
 NW_KAS.10.b: "Let's get them out of our neighborhoods"
 NW_KAS.10.c: "Let's turn to the Mongolian government"
 NW_KAS.11.t: "Muhiti's return from China"
 NW_KAS.11.d: "Our leader Mahmud Muhiti has finally returned from his journey through India to China to seek support from the government of the Republic of China. His return will bring us not only the resources to continue the struggle, but also moral confidence among the soldiers in our imminent victory."
 NW_KAS.11.a: "Long live Muhiti!"
 NW_KAS.12.t: "Muhithi is Back from Kabul"
 NW_KAS.12.d: "Our leader Mahmud Muhiti has finally returned from his journey through India to China to seek support from the government of the Republic of China. However, he was unable to get urgent help from the Nanking politicians, so he began to look for other parties interested in our support. These turned out to be the Afghan rulers from Kabul. Their military and weapons capabilities are much weaker, but they can send their own volunteers."
 NW_KAS.12.a: "The replenishment will come in handy"
 NW_KAS.13.t: "Arrival of Uyghur Rebel Leader"
 NW_KAS.13.d: "Another uprising of the Muslim population against the central authorities took place in China's Xinjiang. The leader of the local Uyghurs, Mahmud Muhiti, after his subordinates began to revolt, went to neighboring countries to seek support. After months of wandering the world, he was rebuffed by virtually all the forces he had hoped for: the Chinese, the British, and the Afghans. Desperate, and having received reliable reports from Xinjiang that his subordinates had been defeated, he decided to make the hajj to Mecca to replenish his spirits and reflect on his future and the political future of the Uyghurs."
 NW_KAS.13.a: "Here in Mecca, many Muslim politicians can find peace of mind"
 NW_KAS.15.t: "The Return of Muhiti"
 NW_KAS.15.d: "Mahmud Muhiti, the leader of our rebellion and division commander, returned to us after a year's absence. Unfortunately, he came back with nothing. His hopes that any country would be interested in supporting our uprising were not realized. However, many soldiers and officers were still very encouraged by Mahmud's return and perhaps because of this we will be able to turn the tide of the battle around."
 NW_KAS.15.a: "Long live Muhiti!"
 NW_KAS.16.t: "Mahmud Muhiti's Arrival in Japan."
 NW_KAS.16.d: "Today, a group of Uyghur politicians led by Mahmud Muhiti, the leader of several uprisings in Xinjiang, or East Turkestan, arrived in Kobe city. With the support of our ambassador to Afghanistan, they were able to obtain temporary visas. The purpose of their visit is to contact our government in order to support our war with China and to free their homeland from the hands of Chinese colonizers. Some religious Muslim leaders of our country are also going to meet with them, and some of the military are interested in them to use them as agents of their influence."
 NW_KAS.16.a: "We will keep them within our sphere of influence"
 NW_KAS.17.t: "Arrival of Uyghur Leaders in Kabul"
 NW_KAS.17.d: "Today, a group of Uyghur politicians led by Mahmud Muhiti, the leader of several uprisings in Xinjiang or East Turkistan, arrived in our capital, Kabul. Mahmud and his supporters have recently made the Hajj to Mecca over the past year and having found no other sponsors to help liberate their homeland from Chinese colonizers, decided to turn to us. They offer us to cooperate and organize an uprising in the territory of East Turkistan."
 NW_KAS.17.a: "That's a good point."
 NW_KAS.18.t.a: "The Fate of the Uyghur Rebels"
 NW_KAS.18.t.b: "The Arrival of the Uyghur Rebels"
 NW_KAS.18.d: "Today, a group of politicians from Xinjiang led by Mahmud Muhiti arrived in our capital. They are mostly his entourage and some officers of his army who died in battle. He was involved in a long confrontation in the province, including several Uyghur separatist uprisings, but having failed to get any international support, they apparently decided out of desperation to enlist our help to restore some form of power in the province."
 NW_KAS.18.a: "Arrest 'em"
 NW_KAS.18.b: "We're gonna need them again"
 NW_KAS.19.t: "The King's Arrival in Kashgar"
 NW_KAS.19.d: "Some time later our new king Khalid Sheldrake with his family and servants finally reached Kashgar. His procession was greeted with great jubilation by the inhabitants of the capital, for an agitation had been made in advance among the people. The king's residence would be located in the house of one of the wealthy merchants of the city who had agreed to sell it. A ceremony will soon be held to enthrone King Khalid I."
 NW_KAS.19.a: "Viva Khalid!"
 NW_KAS.20.t: "The Liquidation of the Kingdom"
 NW_KAS.20.d: "Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader]proclaimed today, at a regular session of the National Assembly, the abolition of the monarchy in our country because it "has not satisfied the Uyghur people but has profited from their wealth". At the same minutes, armed men, the most loyal soldiers of the army, entered the king's palace and, under threat of arrest, demanded that the king leave the country the same day. With little or no further support, he had no choice but to obey. Already in the evening he set out with his family for India by the same road by which he had once arrived here. His property also went to the credit of the State. In the meantime, the National Assembly proclaimed again the Republic of East Turkistan."
 NW_KAS.20.a: "An ignominious end"
 NW_KAS.22.t: "The Death of the Prime Minister"
 NW_KAS.22.d: "Today our country was hit by the terrible news that Mahmud Muhiti, the kingdom's permanent Prime Minister, died of a brain hemorrhage at his home in Kashgar. Death crept up on him so unnoticed even though doctors had told him that he was under too much strain during his work. He was only 57 years old. Now the country is on the brink of political chaos, as the state apparatus never once needed to elect a new prime minister during Khalid's reign. Perhaps this is a chance for fundamental and important changes to be implemented by the king - for when else can he exercise his major powers?."
 NW_KAS.22.a: "It's not worth risking the throne, we'll choose a trustworthy man."
 NW_KAS.22.b: "Let's use the chance and propose a constitutional reform"
 NW_KAS.23.t: "The Constitutional Reform"
 NW_KAS.23.d: "Leading representatives of political elites agreed to support the king's idea of constitutional reform and the introduction of a full-fledged parliament with parties and elections, especially since some proto-party organizations existed during the Muhiti regime. The interim government of Masud Sabri will exist for a month, during which time elections to the National Assembly will be held and the new permanent Prime Minister will be known."
 NW_KAS.23.a: "The reforms succeeded"
 NW_KAS.24.t: "The Compromise Reform"
 NW_KAS.24.d: "The leading representatives of the country's political elites agreed in lengthy talks with the king that democratization is necessary for the country, but they consider it hasty to move to a fully constitutional system in the manner of Britain. They consider it acceptable to make the National Assembly a freer body with real parliamentary powers, but to limit the multiparty system for the time being. Accordingly, the prime minister will be chosen rather behind the scenes, by discussion of the highest officials of the state. They also note that this would essentially expand the powers of the king himself."
 NW_KAS.24.a: "Yes, that's a good option. Then Masud Sabri will be the prime minister."
 NW_KAS.24.b: "Yes, that's a good option. Then Amin Bughra will be the prime minister."
 NW_KAS.25.t: "Abdullah Niyaz's coup"
 NW_KAS.25.d: "After the king proposed constitutional reform aimed at democratizing the state system, it was generally supported by civilian politicians such as Masud Sabri and Muhammad Amin Bughra, but it may have been this initial supportive reaction that triggered a coup d'état by the army's top brass, led by Muhiti's closest officer, Abdullah Niyaz. They isolated the monarch in his residence and proclaimed an emergency government."
 NW_KAS.25.a: "This is how reforms end"
 NW_KAS.26.t: "The First Free Elections"
 NW_KAS.26.d: "The first general election to the National Assembly was won by a party organized by Muhammad Amin Bughra - Young Turkistan Party."
 NW_KAS.26.a: "Now he has to form a government"
 NW_KAS.27.t: "The Death of Muhiti"
 NW_KAS.27.desc: "Today our country has been hit by the terrible news that our great leader and father of the nation, Mahmud Muhiti, died of a brain hemorrhage at his home in Kashgar. Death had crept up on him so unnoticed even though doctors had told him that he was under too much strain during his work. The president was only 57 years old. In an emergency session of the National Assembly, the new head of state was elected..."
 NW_KAS.27.a: "...Muhammad Amin Bughra"
 NW_KAS.27.b: "...Abdullah Niyaz"
 NW_KAS.27.c: "Masud Sabri"
 NW_KAS.27.d: "A military man inherits a military man..."
 NW_KAS.28.t: "The Perfect Timing"
 NW_KAS.28.d: "Back in 1934, when the Bughra brothers first decided to start a rebellion in their hometown of Khotan, they first proclaimed the so-called short-lived "Khotan Emirate" and made Muhammad Amin the first emir, as he was a very respected and well-known man in the city. Then, for strategic purposes, Amin had to relinquish this title and entered into an uninterrupted series of alliances supporting other rulers. However, now that he has regained full power in his hands, it may be worth revisiting this exotic idea, albeit one that contradicts some of Amin's own reformist aspirations."
 NW_KAS.28.a: "We will not break the established order"
 NW_KAS.28.b: "Justice will be done"
 NW_KAS.29.t: "Elections to the National Assembly"
 NW_KAS.29.d: "Today, the next elections to our parliament, the National Assembly, are being held, and the results will determine who will form the new government. The winner will be..."
 NW_KAS.29.a: "$KAS_democratic_party1_long$"
 NW_KAS.29.b: "$KAS_democratic_party3_long$"
 NW_KAS.30.t: "Advocacy for the establishment of an independent Uyghur state"
 NW_KAS.30.d: "Mahmud Muhiti, military governor of Kashgar and commander of the 6th Uyghur Division stationed in our region, is gradually becoming the center of opposition to Sheng Shicai's rule. Through their organizations that publish newspapers and educate people, Muhiti's supporters advocate the formation of an independent Uyghur state. This violates the agreements that were made with Mahmud in 1934 when he became governor of Kashgar province."
 NW_KAS.30.a: "They're provoking us..."
 NW_KAS.31.t: "Mahmud Muhiti wants weapons"
 NW_KAS.31.d: "In Xinjiang Province, the farthest province from China's central government, a political conflict over control of the territory has long been raging. In addition, it is complicated by the complex inter-ethnic relations between the Chinese and the Dungan and Uyghur peoples, who do not have their own states and have a different religion. At the moment, Uyghur leader Mahmut Muhiti has become the center of opposition to the government of Governor Sheng Shicai. Since the middle of the year, he and his men have been promoting the idea of an "independent Uyghur state." He is supported by Muslim religious leaders and influential people in the province. Now Muhiti has asked our consul in Kashgar to receive weapons from us. It is quite possible that he needs them in order to revolt against Sheng."
 NW_KAS.31.a: "We're not interested in that"
 NW_KAS.31.b: "Reject Muhiti and inform Sheng of the impending rebellion"
 NW_KAS.32.t: "Mahmut Muhiti is preparing an uprising in Kashgar"
 NW_KAS.32.d: "The Soviets informed us that Mahmut Muhiti, commander of the 6th Uyghur Division, was preparing an uprising against us and requested Soviet assistance with arms. He obviously did not know that we also have ears in Soviet consulates and embassies. We should try to deal with this conflict peacefully, as we may inadvertently provoke another civil war within the province."
 NW_KAS.32.a: "We have a plan to do it peacefully."
