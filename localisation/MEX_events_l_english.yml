  mexico.1.t:0 "REBELS ATTACK TRAIN!"
  mexico.1.d:0 "A Mexico City-Veracruz train was ambushed yesterday by dissidents, killing multiple PRM Mexican politicians. The train was ambushed at a bridge, where rebels sabotaged the bridge with explosives. The train was found by officials completely destroyed by fire. It is not known if the explosion set fire to the cars, or they were set on fire by the attackers to destroy evidence. Mexico has been facing increasing political polarization, and now it seems political extremists are now resorting to violence."
  mexico.1.a:0 "I don't know what's going on in Mexico, but at this point I am too afraid to ask."
  mexico.1.b:0 "Calles will pay for this, in time."
 
  mexico.2.t:0 "Operation: Mi Lucha"
  mexico.2.d:0 "We finally have a reason to arrest Calles. Public support for his arrest is high, if we can surround his rancho with troops he would have nowhere to run, and no time to warn his fellow rebels. While he is being detained, we can dismantle what is left of his base and wipe the slate clean."
  mexico.2.a:0 "Put an end to his ideological crusade."
  #RANDOMIZER IS #3. SKIP IT.
  mexico.4.t:0 "FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT  EXILED!"
  mexico.4.d:0 "Former President Plutarco Elias Calles, and 3 of his right hand men, have been arrested by orders of President [Root.GetLeader]. Mexico's leftists have accused Calles of trying to ferment dissent among the right wing against President Cardenas, whom he calls a communist, and possibly force the country into a civil war. When the Mexican authorities stormed the rancho, they arrested Calles laying in his bed, reading a spanish Translation of Hitler's book "Mein kampf." A crate of weapons, presumably for supplying rebels, were also recovered. Calles was then forced onto a plane in the dead of night, heading for Houston, Texas. Calles arrived in the morning, and is said to be on his way to San Diego where he will live with his sister."
  mexico.4.a:0 "Okay, now I AM too afraid to ask what's going on in Mexico."
  mexico.4.b:0 "They are not sending their best, folks."
  mexico.4.c:0 "Calles got the same treatment he gave to so many others."

  mexico.6.t:0 "Calles Rebellion!"
  mexico.6.d:0 "Callista supporters have begun a revolt in Mexico in response to what they call the "soviet-ification" of Mexico. Whipped into a frenzy by Plutarco's rhetoric, his supporters have plunged Mexico into yet another civil war. It remains to be seen if this rebellion reaches the brutality of the Mexican revolution, which tore Mexico apart for 10 years."

  mexico.7.t:0 "Oil Worker Strikes"
  mexico.7.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader],  workers are striking against unfair treatment by the foreign companies that bought out the Aguila oil company. They have blatantly broken many of our laws before, and dealing with them will receive little to no backlash among Mexicans. It is best to nationalize the oil company under the constitutional statute that asserts our ownership over all natural resources. Oil nationalization would help fund our country's industrialization, and if war were to happen we would stand to make substantial profit."
  mexico.7.a:0 "Let's make a power play."
  
  mexico.8.t:0 "MEXICO NATIONALIZES OIL COMPANIES!"
  mexico.8.d:0 "[MEX.GetLeader] has announced the nationalization of oil companies within Mexico. The previously foreign companies shall be confiscated and put under the control of PEMEX, the state run oil company. This disproportionately effects UK and Dutch companies, who are demanding their governments go to war. America is largely unsure whether to condone or condemn the nationalization, as the presence in the Mexican oil market was not only negligible, but the nationalization helps their business by eliminating foreign competition."
  mexico.8.a:0 "This is insane, Mexico will start a war!"
  mexico.8.b:0 "Outrageous! They dare steal our propery?!"
  mexico.8.c:0 "Now we wait and see their response."
  
  mexico.9.t:0 "Mexico nationalizes oil!"
  mexico.9.d:0 "Mexico has announced the nationalization of any natural resource assets in the country. Lobbyists are demanding war, but it will get politically messy right when Germany's rising power is a much more clear threat. If we wage a war, we will have less manpower, and resources to deal with Germany. The terrain is rough, and it will likely be a drawn out war. Our other option is to embargo them and force them to return our holdings when Mexico realizes it doesn't have the expertise to run an oil company."
  mexico.9.a:0 "Declare War"

  mexico.11.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has announced that Mexico shall be embargoed in response to the nationalization of American Oil Companies in Mexico. Political Analysts call this an attempt starve out Mexico's state owned oil company, PEMEX, and force Mexico to return the nationalized assets."
  mexico.11.a:0 "Lets see if PEMEX survives."
  mexico.11.b:0 "They're trying to starve us out."

  mexico.13.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has announced a declaration of war on Mexico over outrage over the confiscation of oil assets from American companies. [USA.GetLeader] has stated that it must defend American interests, and will not stand for Mexican posturing against American companies. [MEX.GetLeader] has responded that foreign ownership of the oil was not legal to begin with under Mexican law, and that any future president had the legal right to enforce the law. [MEX.GetLeader] has also stated that they will fight to protect their constitution from foreign interests."
  mexico.13.a:0 "My God."
  mexico.13.b:0 "Dios Mio."
  
  mexico.14.t:0 "UK declares war on Mexico!"
  mexico.14.d:0 "The United Kingdom has declared a state of war on Mexico, over its nationalization of over 130 million dollars of assets. [ENG.GetLeader] has stated that "It does not matter if America is with us or against us, the United Kingdom will not be pushed around!" Needless to say, it seems Mexico is in a very tough spot."
  mexico.14.a:0 "My God."
  mexico.14.b:0 "Dios Mio."
  
  mexico.15.t:0 "Compensation"
  mexico.15.d:0 "Now that we are under an embargo and war has been temporarily averted, it might be time to offer to pay 29 million dollars in reparations to America, who have been demanding compensation for the affected enterprises. This will fully avoid war with the United States and lift the embargo, but place a temporary strain on our budget. However, the expansion of our possible markets would outweigh the penalty."
  mexico.15.a:0 "They want compensation? I'd like to see them try."
  mexico.15.b:0 "Pay them compensation, and end this."

  mexico.21.t:0 "SLEEPY LAGOON MURDERS"
  mexico.21.d:0 "Sleepy Lagoon, a popular hangout and lover's lane for Mexican teens who are often denied admission to public pools, is the site of a grisly murder as the body of Mexican citizen and US serviceman José Díaz was found. Díaz was found unconscious, intoxicated, and suffered blunt force trauma. Diaz later died from his injuries at Los Angeles General Hospital. Police scoured the city for the culprits and arrested the leader of the 38th street gang, Hank Leyvas, his girlfriend Dora Barrios, and 20 other Mexican-Americans out of 600 Mexican Americans rounded up by LAPD. Hank denies any tie to the murder. Tensions have been running high in Los Angeles between Angelenos and Pachucos, otherwise known as zoot suiters, and it seems the tensions won't be resolved any time soon."
  mexico.21.a:0 "A disgusting act."
  
  mexico.22.t:0 "SLEEPY LAGOON TRIAL"
  mexico.22.d:0 "The trial of the Sleepy Lagoon murder begun today, with Hank and 21 others pleading not guilty. Hank pleaded that he and his girlfriend were attacked at Sleepy Lagoon that night by a group of men. Hank, assuming it was a gang related attack, called his gang to Sleepy Lagoon to find the attackers. They found a party near the site of the attack, and assumed it was the attackers came from there. A fight broke out between the gang and the partiers, lasting about 10 minutes. The coroner states that Diaz's injuries were inconsistent with a fight, as it more likely Diaz was hit by a car while drunk. The prosecution put forward E. Duran Ayres,chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, to state that Mexicans as a whole are bloodthirsty and contain a biological urge to kill past down from their Aztec ancestors."
  mexico.22.a:0 "This won't end well."
  
  mexico.23.t:0 "HANK CONVICTED"
  mexico.23.d:0 "The Sleepy Lagoon case has come to a close, as Hank and 16 others have been convicted of murder. The men of the gang are to be sent to San Quentin prison while their girlfriends, under suspiscion of accessory, were to be sent to the notorious Ventura School for Girls, a reformatory institution for deliquent and sexually promiscuous girls. Ventura's reputation is exceedingly harsh, and women sentenced there often attempt suicide before being transferred there. It is reported one girl has tried swallowing safety pins in an attempt to escape her sentence."
  mexico.23.a:0 "Maybe tensions will die down now."
  
  mexico.24.t:0 "ZOOT SUIT RIOTS"
  mexico.24.d:0 "Racial tensions have exploded in Los Angeles, as an altercation between a group of pachucos and US servicemen have erupted into a race riot. Thousands of US servicemen are leaving their bases in droves to attack Mexicans, as civilians have taken to driving to Los Angeles to participate in the riots, with some servicemen abandoning their post from as far away as Los Vegas to Riot in Los Angeles. Servicemen were seen raiding bars theaters and cafes to drag out Mexican youths, some of them children, to be stripped naked and beaten as their clothes were burned. A smaller mob has descended on the Black neighborhood of Watts. LAPD has refused to take action against the riots stating "Well, we represented public opinion. Many of us were in the First World War, and we're not going to pick on kids in the service." "
  mexico.24.a:0 "Horrific."
  
  mexico.25.t:0 "MEXICO OUTRAGED"
  mexico.25.d:0 "Mexico is outraged over the disgraceful handling of the Zoot Suit riots, with the Sinarquistas stating that the attacks on Mexican citizens by the United States armed forces constitutes an act of war. The sinarquistas go onto say that in order to protect the race from further harm by American forces, Mexico must reclaim the land it once held. The communist and left wing nationalists back this stance as well, stating that what has been done cannot be forgiven. The situation has spiralled out of control, and it is not known whether Mexican-American diplomacy will ever recover."
  mexico.25.a:0 "Things are getting out of control."
  
  mexico.26.t:0 "Intel: Los Angeles, California"
  mexico.26.d:0 "We have devised a plan to use the Mexican immigrants immigrating to the United States to be informants for our intelligence services. Many left to escape the revolution, and some are even in the military! Its possible that we might find some Mexican patriots to pass along crucial information."
  mexico.26.a: "See what you can do."
