 POLITICS_MUSTAFA_KEMAL_ATATURK_DESC:0 "Mustafa Kemal was not born into the family of a rich official or a high-ranking general, but thanks to his personal determination and initiative, he was able to lead the Turkish people and prevent the country from being divided into several colonies by the Entente countries. But his policy was not characterized by hatred of Europe - on the contrary, it was based on the Europeanization and modernization of Turkish society, as well as on Turkish nationalism. For all his services, Mustafa Kemal received the surname atatürk-the father of the Turks."
 POLITICS_PIERRE_LAVAL_DESC:0 "Strong leader, always knowing what to do Pierre Laval was not in vain appointed by the Parliament of France of the so-called Republican dictator rule by decree opened new opportunities to strengthen state control over the media has created all necessary conditions for public support policies. However, the socialists do not particularly like Laval for his support of Mussolini's fascist regime and authoritarian forms of government; the Prime Minister, in response, does everything possible to defeat left-wing politicians."
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "An ordinary man who went through the horrors of the First world war, the poverty and political scene of Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, appealed to the hearts of the Germans, was able to come to the position of the absolute leader of the new German Reich, idolized by his comrades and ordinary Germans. As for non-Germans, the Fuhrer treats them with caution at best, and more often with hatred and a desire to destroy. Critics and opponents of the ruler and his course have disappeared, or will disappear soon. The genius of Adolf Hitler, as they believe in Germany, will ensure the prosperity of the thousand-Year-old Reich in any case, no matter how insidious the enemies who were tearing Germany apart with sadistic rapture turned out to be."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_STALIN_DESC:0 "Given the reins of power after Lenin's death and a brief period of intense internal political struggle, Stalin led the young state through unprecedented enterprises to overcome years of backwardness, in a decade pulling Soviet Russia, which United around itself a dozen socialist republics, out of ruin and poverty, leading it to the title of one of the most powerful powers on the planet. The friend, Leader and Teacher of the Soviet people is loved and respected, even if his paranoia has become noticeably more severe, and his conceit has grown. Millions of people who sincerely praise the Father of Nations, however, do not notice this at all, being confident in the loyalty of the course of Joseph Vissarionovich, which he leads the Soviet country."

 POLITICS_REZA_SHAH_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Having declared himself the shahinshah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi began a policy of modernization to make his homeland an advanced regional power. He actively carried out new reforms, destroying the old way of life: under him, political parties began to form, the consciousness of the subjects grew, and the influence of the clergy weakened. All this, according to the monarch, is possible only for great people, which included himself and Adolf Hitler, which was due to the huge role of Germany in the formation of the Iranian economy. But, in any case, these facts could not overshadow the past of Reza Shah, who used to be the head of the Cossack brigade - he still pays special attention to the needs of the army."
 POLITICS_ABU_L_HASSAN_AL_ISFAHANI_DESC:0 "Abu l-Hasan al-Isfahani earned authority among Muslims while still living in Iraq, but first of all, the spiritual leader of the Shiites is known not even for his religious activities, but for his work in law. For example, he owns an outstanding work "Device of An-Najat", highly appreciated by his contemporaries."

However, in addition to his achievements in the military and political career, he has an incredible ambition, bordering on megalomania: as a result, everything they do is only to achieve their own selfish goals; this leaves an imprint on all their activities."

 POLITICS_Juah_Nimley_DESC:0 "Joachim - chief of the KRU tribes. He decided to challenge the Whig rule and stand up for the people of Liberia."
 POLITICS_Thomas_Folkner_DESC:0 "Faulkner is one of the few people to challenge the despotism of the true Whig party. A successful industrialist, Commissioner of Monrovia, he did a lot for the region hoping to make an industrial breakthrough. He gathered like-minded people around him, but lost the election against Charles king, in an election that was called the most corrupt in human history. After losing the next election, he opposed the entire Whig government, exposing slavery to the League of Nations, but it did nothing. Only with the support of Nimli, he was able to achieve a positive result and win new elections, after which he began to fully industrialize the country."
